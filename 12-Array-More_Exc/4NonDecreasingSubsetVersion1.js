// Write a function that extracts only those numbers that form a non-decreasing subset.
// In other words, you start from the first element
// and continue to the end of the given array of numbers.
// Any number which is LESS THAN the current biggest one is ignored,
// alternatively if itâ€™s equal or higher than the current
// biggest one you set it as the current biggest one
// and you continue to the next number. 
// Input
// The input comes as an array of numbers.
// Output
// The output is the processed array after the filtration,
// which should be a non-decreasing subset.
// The elements should be printed on one line, separated by a single space.
